Major Update to Game Class
Turn taking is now functional between players. Removed unnecessary methods, added more comments for more readable code, organized methods. 
Issues still present: when player chooses the card and the pile, if valid the card needs to be place onto the selected pile and removed from the players hand. If the move is invalid the user needs to be prompted that the move is invalid and should be prompted the three choices again: place card, move pile, or end turn

Pushed the current stage of the product.
--issues that need to be fixed:
Need to establish how two players are going to take turns, how to present the choices the user has, and the program needs to end when a user wins.
